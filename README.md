 ##This is the Back End of a Pick To Light/Put To Light system.  
 
 ###System  
 **Server**  
Server keeps track of all node activites in MongoDB, the server is run using spring boot  
 **MasterNode**  
Master routes data from ScannerNodes, SubNodes and Server, there can be only one master for a cluster of nodes  
 **ScannerNode**  
Scanner nodes are QR code scanning devices, When a QR code is scanned, a sub node should light up, there maybe n number of scannerNodes  
 **SubNode**  
Subnodes are boxes that objects are stored, when a designated object is scanned by the scanner, the appropriate subnode will lightup, there maybe n number of subnodes  
 
 ###Node Registration  
 -Node sends registration request to server  
 -Server sends registration data  
 -Two way acknowledgment is done  
 
 ##Data  
-ScannerNode scans object  
-A new ScanData is generated by ScannerNode and Send to Master  
-Master Posts the the ScanData to Server  
-Server Takes ScanData and acknowledges to the ScannerNode  
-After acknowledgment, the server Post data proproprite subnode  
-The SubNode and server exchange acknowledgment  
-Then the subnode sends acknowledgment for the scannerNode that goes though the server and master  

###Reconfig
-Server admin can change node config  
-Data has to be shutdown for config change  
-Server reruns registration  
 
 
###Software platform  
-Maven Project  
-Java 17  
-Spring Boot 2.7.3  
-Jar package  
-MongoDB & MongoExpress
